Healthcare Data Analysis with SQL
📌 Project Overview

This project explores a healthcare database containing patients, appointments, and medical records. Using SQL, I performed queries to extract meaningful insights about hospital operations, patient demographics, diagnoses, and doctor performance.

📂 Dataset Description

The database consists of three main tables:

Patients: Contains patient details such as PatientID, Name, Age, Gender.

Appointments: Tracks appointments with fields like AppointmentID, PatientID, DoctorID, Department, Status, and AppointmentDate.

MedicalRecords: Stores diagnosis and health details including RecordID, PatientID, Diagnosis, and BloodPressure.

🛠️ SQL Skills Applied

Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

Aggregations (COUNT, AVG, ROUND, DISTINCT)

Grouping & Filtering (GROUP BY, HAVING)

Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, OVER)

CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

📊 Key Analysis Performed

Counted cancelled vs completed appointments to measure hospital efficiency.

Found the top 5 most common diagnoses with patient counts.

Ranked doctors by number of appointments handled.

Calculated the percentage of cancelled appointments per doctor.

Analyzed average blood pressure by diagnosis.

Computed department-wise appointments, patient counts, and average age.
